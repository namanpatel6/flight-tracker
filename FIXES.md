# Tracked Flight Creation Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. **Schema Mismatch**: The API route was trying to use a `date` field in the `TrackedFlight` model, but this field was removed from the schema during a migration.

2. **User ID Handling**: The API route was using `session.user.id` directly, but the JWT token might not have the correct user ID format that matches the database.

3. **API Rate Limiting**: The AviationStack API was returning a 429 error (Too Many Requests), which was causing the flight creation to fail.

4. **Turbopack Caching**: Old code was being cached by Turbopack, causing the wrong version of the code to be executed.

## Fixes Applied

1. **Updated API Route**:
   - Modified the route to fetch the user from the database using the email from the session
   - Changed the query to use `departureTime` instead of `date` for checking existing flights
   - Split the flight creation into two steps: create with basic data first, then update with API data if available

2. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - Added better error messages and logging
   - Ensured the API continues even if the flight data API call fails

3. **Enhanced User Interface**:
   - Improved validation and formatting of flight numbers
   - Added default date selection to today's date
   - Better feedback for loading and error states

4. **Cache Clearing**:
   - Cleared the Next.js build cache to ensure the latest code is being used

## Testing

We created several test scripts to verify the fixes:

1. **Direct Database Test**: Successfully created a tracked flight directly through the database
2. **API Test**: Confirmed that the API requires authentication (as expected)
3. **Test User Creation**: Added a test user to the database for testing purposes

## How to Use

1. Make sure you're signed in to the application
2. Go to the Tracked Flights page
3. Click "Track New Flight"
4. Enter a flight number (e.g., "BA123")
5. Select a date
6. Click "Track Flight"

The application will now:
1. Create a basic tracked flight entry immediately
2. Attempt to fetch additional flight details from the API
3. Update the tracked flight with the additional details if available
4. Show a success message when the flight is tracked

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify that you're properly authenticated
3. Try using a different flight number or date
4. If the API rate limit is reached, the flight will still be created with basic information

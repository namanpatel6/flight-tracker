This document describes the architecture for the app. Follow these rules to ensure the app can be deployed successfully.

1. Simplicity should be at the heart of the architecture. Make sure to keep the architecture as simple as possible. Refer to the [file-structure.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/file-structure.mdc) file for generating any required files related to the architecture/deployment of the code. If you have any questions regarding the structure, ask me first before making any code changes.

2. It should scale in case the project becomes more complex down the line.

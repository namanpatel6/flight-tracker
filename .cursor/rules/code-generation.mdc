Follow these rules while generating code:

1. Always generate code following all the rules defined in the .cursor/rules directory.
2. Always ask me before actually committing/saving the changes to the files.
3. if you have any questions about anything related to the project/task at hand, stop and ask me to clarify your doubts. Do not assume anything.
4. Always commit changes to github once every few collections of changes. Also, ask me specifically if I want to commit my changes if you're making a change that affects a lot of files.
5. Make sure to test the code after making every change to verify nothing breaks before moving on.
